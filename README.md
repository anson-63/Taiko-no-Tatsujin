#Taiko WPF — Rhythm Game in C#
A Windows WPF implementation of a Taiko-style rhythm game. Built in C# with XAML animations and storyboard-driven UI. Gameplay is time-accurate to audio and .tja charts, with local multiplayer, difficulty selection, and configurable controls/multipliers.

-Smooth page flows: Title → Song Select → Gameplay → Results
-Timing-accurate judgments (Perfect/Good/Miss) with combo, rating text, and SFX
-Big-note logic (simultaneous dual-key presses)
-.tja chart parsing with audio-time synced notes
-Local multiplayer (P1/P2 lanes with separate keybinds)
-Configurable score multiplier and key bindings
-Results artwork varies by score and difficulty
##Demo (Overview)
-Storyboard + DoubleAnimation for fades and moving backgrounds
-Absolute, audio-synced note positioning to prevent drift/lag
-Media playback via System.Windows.Media.MediaPlayer

##Features
-Pages: Title, Song Selection, Gameplay, Result
-UI: Smooth fades and moving backgrounds via Storyboard + DoubleAnimation
-Judgments: Timing-accurate hit/miss with combo display, rating text (“良”, “可”), and SFX
-Big Notes: Requires near-simultaneous dual keys of the same color
-Charts: Reads .tja and syncs notes to audio time
-Difficulty: Redesign with multiple levels and mapping via dictionaries
-Multiplayer: P1 + P2 lanes with independent keybinds
-Config: Score multiplier (scaler) and key bindings on the Controls page
-Results: Artwork selected by totalscore and difficulty
##Project Structure
-asset/ — images, sounds, results artwork, etc.
-Models/, pages/ — game models and WPF Pages (Title, Select, Gameplay, Result, Controls)
-App.xaml, MainWindow.xaml — app shell and navigation
-Taiko.csproj, Taiko.sln — project/solution files
Note: bin/, obj/, .vs/ and other build artifacts are intentionally excluded.

##Gameplay Rules
Timing windows (relative to the judgment line):
-Perfect (“良”): |Δt| ≤ 0.05s → +100 points (×2 for big notes)
-Good (“可”): within the overall hit range but not perfect → +50 points (×2 for big notes)
-Miss: note passes > 0.18s late (auto-miss) or unhit

Input mapping:
-Don keys → small/big Don (types 1, 3)
-Kat keys → small/big Ka (types 2, 4)
-Big notes (types 3, 4): after the first press, within ~30 ms both L+R keys of the same color must be held; otherwise ignored and will miss.

On hit:
-Combo +1, show combo and rating text, play SFX, remove note

On miss:
-Combo resets, miss count +1, remove note

##Scoring
Totalscore:
-totalscore = (perfect × 100 × scaler) + (good × 50 × scaler) − (miss × 50 ÷ scaler)

Notes:
-scaler is the user-selected score multiplier from the Controls page
-Result page selects images based on totalscore and difficulty

##Architecture Notes
-WPF with Storyboard + DoubleAnimation for:
--Title fade-in/out text
--Song Select moving background
-Absolute, audio-time-based positioning in the render loop to avoid drift and animation lag
-Audio via System.Windows.Media.MediaPlayer
-.tja parsed by a helper class (TjaParser) to populate notes
-Static config variables (e.g., Controlpage.scaler) shared across pages
-Dictionaries map difficulties and related settings
##Controls
Single player (default):
-Don (red): Left/Right key pair (e.g., F/J)
-Kat (blue): Left/Right key pair (e.g., D/K)
-Big notes: press both left+right of the same color nearly simultaneously

Local multiplayer:
-Player 2 has its own four keys (Don L/R, Kat L/R)
-Duplicate lane rendered; logic mirrors Player 1
All bindings are configurable on the Controls page. Choose a multiplier (scaler) from the dropdown.

##Getting Started
Prerequisites:
-Windows 10/11
-.NET Desktop SDK (matching the project’s TargetFramework)
-Visual Studio with the WPF workload, or the dotnet CLI

Build/run:
-Visual Studio: open Taiko.sln and Run
-CLI:
--dotnet restore
--dotnet build
--dotnet run --project Taiko.csproj

##Adding Songs
-Place audio (e.g., .ogg/.mp3) and the matching .tja chart into the expected songs directory used by the app (see asset/ or configuration in code)
-Select the song on the Song Selection page
